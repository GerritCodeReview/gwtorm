      "message": "| Do we _really_ want to call rollback() in a finally clause?\n\nYes, we do. Because something can go wrong in between, e. g. in updateChange() conuccrent modification exception may be thrown (optimistic database locking).\n\n| I see that JdbcSchema#rollback() only rollsback when autoCommit is disabled, but then tries to enable autoCommit\n\nYes, you are right, but it works and we don\u0027t care.",

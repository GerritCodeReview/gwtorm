And there is no\n\n  create table cnt ... \n\nstatement executed in entire PostgreSQL test (and other unit tests except MySQL)..\n\nNote, that MySQL dialect contains drop(\"cnt\") because it lacks sequence feature and sequences on MySQL are emulated over normal tables that possesses column with type serial; List sequences scan all tables in schema and recognize all tables that have column from type serial as sequences.\n\nAll other supported Jdbc dialects:\n\n* H2\n* PostgreSQL\n* Oracle\n* MaxDB/SaoDB\n\nhave native sequence support and don√Ñt create cnt table. but cnt sequence.",

It was failing for the same reason that you described in your conditional skipping fix change, that checking out my commit where i introduced conditional test skipping was still failing and not skipping. And the reason for that is:\n\n Maven is crap and totally sucks.\n\nAnd after one year life with Buck we have forgotten that the first command in poop Maven era is *always*:\n\n  mvn clean\n\nAnd only after that you can proceed with:\n\n  mvn test\n\nor whatever. That because Maven is crap and totally  sucks. Have i said it already? ;)",

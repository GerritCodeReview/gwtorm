To test DialectHANA a SAP HANA JDBC driver ngdbc.jar is
needed. It is not available in a public maven repository. However, the driver
can be found as described here:

To execute tests on HANA, you firstly need to create a test user with an
associated empty schema in your database. Then you can execute the tests
using maven with the profile "hana". The following properties need to be set:

hana.driver.jar=<path to HANA JDBC driver>
hana.url=<url of test database>
hana.user=<user name>
hana.password=<password of test user>

So the complete command would be:

mvn package -P hana
  -Dhana.driver.jar=<path to HANA JDBC driver>
  -Dhana.url=<url of test database>
  -Dhana.user=<user name>
  -Dhana.password=<password of test user>

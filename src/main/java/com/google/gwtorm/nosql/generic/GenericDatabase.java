/**
 * Base class for generic NoSQL typed databases.
 * <p>
 * The generic types provide basic NoSQL implementation assuming a handful of
 * primitive operations are available inside of the implementation's extension
 * of {@link GenericSchema}. All relations are stored within the same key space,
 * using the relation name as a prefix for the row's primary or secondary key.
 * <p>
 * Applications should use the database class to create instances of their
 * Schema extension interface, and thus open and connect to the data store.
 * <p>
 * Creating a new database instance is expensive, due to the type analysis and
 * code generation performed to implement the Schema and Access interfaces.
 * Applications should create and cache their database instance for the life of
 * the application.
 * <p>
 * Database instances are thread-safe, but returned Schema instances are not.
 * <p>
 * This class must be further extended by the NoSQL implementation to configure
 * the connectivity with the data store and supply the correct subclass of
 * {@link NoSqlSchema} that knows how to interact with the data store.
 *
 * @param <T> type of the application's Schema.
 * @param <S> type of the implementation's base for Schema implementations.
 * @param <A> type of the implementation's base for Access implementations.
